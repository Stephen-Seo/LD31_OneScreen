Entire Game On One Screen
 - No scrolling?
 - Only one screen on the screen stack it seems...

Lets go in the Z direction.
Or does that conflict with the no scrolling restriction?

Platformer?

As you beat the goal, you jump deeper?

scratch that. Or not?


Title screen.

tough theme to think about...


Ok lets go with jumping in the Z direction?

...
Maybe I'll have a better idea after trying to make a song for it.


I slept on it, and decided to make a really tiny platformer where you see the
entire world with an old school RPG battle system.

Will use a second state class for the battle overlay.


==== Battle state ====

Not in battle:
    Display Player status on key "I"
    If feature is in, also able to equip stuff in the status menu

In battle:
    show enemy in the center, stats in the bottom, options in the top
        Earthbound style.
