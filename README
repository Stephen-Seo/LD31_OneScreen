Gradle builds with the expectation that the host platform is Arch Linux 64-bit with multilib-gcc and mingw-w64 installed. If your platform is different, build using cmake instead.

To see what build tasks are available, run ./gradlew tasks

SFML2_DIR (and optionally ResourcePacker_DIR) must be defined for building.
defining EXTLIBS_DIR will enable windows builds.

SFML2_DIR must point to the directory containing a gradle build setup of SFML2.1
ResourcePacker_DIR must point to the directory containing a gradle build setup
of ResourcePacker
EXTLIBS_DIR must point to the extlibs directory in the SFML2.1 sources directory
(This is found in the SFML2.1 sources zip)
